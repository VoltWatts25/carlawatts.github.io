                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>The topic for this website is the progression of Splatoon 3. I chose this topic as my favorite
                        game series
                        is the Splatoon trilogy, even though I haven't played the first one. Since I've been invested in
                        the series
                        as well as the many tournaments about the game, I wanted to make this website about how the game
                        has changed
                        in the first year of its release. I wanted to keep track of the patch notes to see how much was
                        changed in
                        each update, how many points each team has gotten in the first few splatfests, and see what team
                        has won the
                        most throughout all of the tournaments so far.
                        To collect data for this, I looked through the Inkipedia, the Splatoon version of Wikipedia.
                        Through this I
                        had found all of my information on weapon patch notes, each version's updates, all of the
                        splatfest results,
                        and the information about the many championships. Without overwhelming the audience with
                        information, I
                        chose to simplify it down to the amount of changes per update, how many total wins each
                        championship team
                        gets, and how many points each team got in every splatfest.
                        The conclusions I have made based on the data I've collected are that 3 out of the 4 in-game
                        seasons with
                        the first update of the season have the most changes, the only outlier is the Drizzle Season
                        with the third
                        update having the most changes. For the splatfests, I've concluded that Shiver has won the most
                        splatfests,
                        seven out of the ten events. This heavily overshadows Big Man's two wins and Frye's single win.
                        For the
                        Championships, I've concluded that team Starbust has gotten the most wins out of every other
                        team. The fact
                        that they participated in 3 out of the 4 championships shown in the data.</p>
